Building Java8 Functional Application Through TDD:
--------------------------------------------------------
TDD: (Test Driven Development)

    1. What is Maven
    2. Java-8 Features
    3. JUnit Testing
    
    
MAVEN:
------------
Maven is a project management tool.

Before maven what was the problem?
------------------------------------------
Tourism: java, mysql, springboot, hibernate, services etc

OLD approach:
------------------
dependecies: spring-10 , hibernate-12, mysql-1
updation

Using Maven:
---------------------
POM: (project object model) --> pom.xaml ----- dependencies
1. Development is very easy
2. We can add jars and other dependecies very easily
3. It is verry helpful for updating jars and othe dependencies
4. We can develope any type of projet like WAR, JAR
5. We can very easily intergrate our project with Gitlab

---Project Development Steps:
-------------------------------------
1. Requirement Analysis
2. Use Case
3. Development started
4. Testing: Manual, Automated
5. Production release



TDD: (Test driven development):
------------------------------------
Writing fail tests: We are writing test cases
Make test cases passed: We will make sure all the test cases are passed, but we will not be concerned about the quality of code
Refactoring: fine tuning of coding, concise coding

Testing:
---------------------
Checking whether the application is meeting the clinet specific requirement or not.


Testing Types:
    1. Functional Testing
        1. White Box Testing: JUnit Testing ----developer
        2. Black Box Testing: ---- test enginner
    2. Non Functional Testing



Testing Methods or types:
-------------------------------
Itegration testing
Smoke testing
Perfomrance testing
efficiency testing
regration testing
automated testing


Black Box Testing: 



JUnit-5:
--------------------
Junit 5 is testing framework for java applications. in Java 8 very notable chnages has done. In order
to bring the latest coding styles of java8, we use JUnit 5.

JUnit 5=JUnit 4+ ...
JUnit is composed of three modules:
    Junit5= JUnit Jupiter+ JUnit Vintage+Junit Platform
    Jupiter: It include new programming exetension
    Vintage: It provides support for JUnit3, 4
    JUnit platform: launch test cases, IDE
